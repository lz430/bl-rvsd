			After much researching, reviewing and head scratching, we chose the Oransi v-hepa Max Air Purifier as we require a very clean environment due to medical conditions. There were less expensive units out there but we were looking for long term reliability and service and one that REALLY cleaned the air. The Oransi looked best and it really is. Very well built, quiet running and effective. I am so pleased that we found this unit and purchased it. The shipping and delivery were as promised. I had a couple of questions and their Customer Service responded amazingly fast. Happy we have it!!!!!

			This is our second set of air cleaners that we have ordered from you. They are a Godsend for my wife who has severe allergies and asthma and other lung issues. She was exposed to mold and is hypersensitive to any mold or VOCS in the air from cologne, perfume, paint, air pollution, etc. Whenever she can't breathe at home we turn on the Oransi Pro Air Cleaner and within minutes she is able to breathe again. I am an engineer and I appreciate the care that went into the design of this product. The filters are very easy to change and the unit is very quiet at the low and medium settings, and the sound at the high setting where you are moving a lot of air it is not unpleasant. We recently had some drywall work done on our house and the air pollution indicator turned red, but not for long as the air cleaner cleaned the air in a matter of minutes. We are very happy to have found you and will be a customer for life. Thank you again for a wonderful product and the service to back it up.

			I ordered 2 of these and I am very happy with them. They are quieter than the Honeywells I replaced and much easier to open and close when I want to vacuum the carbon filter. This product does not need the main filter replaced for 2 years and this makes a difference when comparing prices. This product is much better quality than my previous air cleaners. I called the company to ask some questions before I purchased these and spoke with a lady named Katie that was so helpful and sweet. This was a refreshing change!

			I purchased this product a few months ago. As soon as I plugged the unit in I could spell the fresh air. I have had bad allergies for years and have suffered with sinus infections etc. Just recovered from a very bad sinus infection that turned into Bronchitus.
		</p>
		<p>
			I was desperate to find something that could help me not get these allergy illnesses. My wife always ran a fan in the room also due to not being able to fall asleep to my bad snoring..Many nights she left the bedroom to sleep in the spare bedroom. She is much happier now also. I do not snore and if I do it is very light. Not like before. She also likes the sound of the fan to help her fall asleep. There is different levels of fan speed and even on the high speed the unit is very quite. The buttons in the front are easy to understand to turn the unit on and change the settings.
		</p>
		<p>
			The filters seem very easy to install. The unit is sleek and can be placed in the room very small foot print of the room. I can say that since buying and using the unit I have not felt congested during this spring season with all the pollen. The air smells much fresher and I am going to put one in our living area of the home. I would recommend to anyone serious about buying a Hepa filter air purifier.
		</p>
		<p>
			My son has very bad allergies also and is now married. He visited over the Holiday and tried out the unit. He also said he felt much better and slept sound. He plans on purchasing also when he goes back home.

			After moving into temporary accommodations, my wife's difficulty sleeping due to allergy-induced congestion became acute and she asked that I attempt to find a portable air purifier that might help alleviate the problem. We had, for several years, used four Sharper Image ionizing units in our prior residence along with an electronic unit built into our HVAC system to address the problem there.
		</p>
		<p>
			After a couple of hours of online research, I decided to try the Oransi v-hepa finn unit and ordered it online with expedited shipping and it showed up a couple of days later-right on schedule. Bottom line: Starting the very first night the unit was plugged in, my wife slept like a baby, and has been ever since. In fact, this morning, she complained that it was really hard to wake up because she has been sleeping so soundly. I don't know how or why, but this item has had far more impact on the air quality in our bedroom than all of the stuff we had plugged in in our last home. We are building a new home and I am seriously considering purchasing two or three more of these units. AMAZING PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE!

I had ordered it through Amazon over 10 months ago and had a malfunction, your staff quickly helped me find the vendor I had used to purchase the Oransi Finn then guided me through the process of getting a replacement delivered at no expense.

			I am pleased to report that the Oransi v-HEPA MAX Air Purifier is indeed really quiet even on the highest speeds. I love that this model is user friendly and it took very little time for me to learn how to use the control features. My favorite feature of this model is the Intelligent Air Quality Monitor which lets me know with a visual indicator whether the current air quality is ‚ÄúExcellent, Very Good, Good, Standard or Poor.‚Äù I am extremely pleased with the Oransi v-HEPA MAX Air Purifier as it gives me confidence that I am using an air purifier in our home that provides my family with better air quality.

			I have really bad allergies. We decided that it would be beneficial to order an air purifier to run in our room at night. When I promptly received my product I set it up in my living room just to try out. Within 20 minutes I felt like my airways opened up! We have been using this in our room every night. My husband doesn't wake up stuffy any more. I would highly recommend this product and want to say that it is worth every penny.

<br /><br />Giving back is at the core of who we are.  We proudly donate 5% of our income to support student education in science, math and engineering.  It's this community connection where we strive to do much more than is expected by investing our dollars and time. It's these sciences where innovations will come from as we strive to continually improve the quality of life.

<br /><br />We sponsor science fairs for students in the elementary through high school levels as well as providing college scholarships to encourage continued research in the sciences.  To date, we have given 6 college scholarships as well as tens of thousands of dollars to sponsor science fairs for nearly 4,000 students per year.

<br /><br />One of our current projects is in supporting the Austin Energy Science Fair and Intel International Science Fair.  Students in the elementary through high school levels work very hard on their experiments and projects as junior scientists and their months of hard work are a testament to their dedication to learning and furthering their knowledge.  

<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Here is a video from Austin Energy that gives an overview to the value of the science fairs that we proudly sponsor.</span><br /><br />

<br /><br />The Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (Intel ISEF), the world‚Äôs largest international pre-college science competition, annually provides a forum for more than 1,500 high school students from over 50 countries, regions, and territories to showcase their independent research. The Intel ISEF is the premiere science competition in the world exclusively for students in grades 9‚Äì12.<br /><br />Another focus for us is in supporting Kiva to provide business loans to entrepreneurs throughout the world.  These investments empower people to improve their lives, communities and in a small way the world in general.

The environment is also a large focus for us.  <br /><br />Check out our <a href=""http://www.oransi.com/environment_s/30.htm"" title=""Environment Oransi"">environment</a> page to see how we are setting new standards to improve the environment we all live in.","",""

Allergy Facts:
1 out of 5 people in the US have allergies or asthma.
55% of people test positive to one or more allergens: more than twice the rate thirty years ago.
Ragweed pollen season has increased by 4 weeks in the last 10 to 15 years.
Odds that a child with one allergic parent will develop allergies: 33%.
Odds that a child with two allergic parents will develop allergies: 70%.
Indoor air in U.S. homes is 2 to 100 times more polluted than outdoor air.
90% of our lives are spent indoors.


Allergy Triggers in Your Home and What You Can Do
Our air purifiers (help me choose) will help with each of these triggers however here are some extra steps you can take that should help.   See Best Air Purifiers for Allergies.

Mold
Mold needs moisture (ie water) to grow and a food source (wallpaper, shower curtains, bath items, etc).  Mold spores travel through the air and flourish in damp or humid environments.  Learn more about mold.
What you can do
If you see mold, clean it up with soap and water or bleach.
Ventilation - use exhaust fans or open a window in the bathroom when showering and open windows on dry days to your basement.
Fix leaky plumbing or other sources of water.
Dry damp or wet items to avoid mold growth and try to keep humidity levels at 35%- 50%.

Pollen
Allergies to pollen are called hay fever and are a common asthma trigger.  The most effective way to deal with pollen allergies is to avoid contact.
What you can do
Try to keep your windows closed.
Limit outdoor activity on high pollen days.
Take your shoes off when you come home, change your clothes, wash your face, eyes and hair (or brush your hair).



Dust Mites
Dust mites are tiny bugs that live in bedding, mattresses, soft furniture, carpets, and stuffed toys, such as stuffed animals and feed off of organic materials such as dried skin flakes.  It‚Äôs not the dust mites specifically that trigger an asthma attack but rather their by-products.
What you can do
Wash bed sheets and blankets once a week and dry completely.  Water must be hotter than 130F to kill the dust mites.  Cold and warm water with detergent and bleach can also be effective.
Use dust-proof covers on pillows and mattresses.
Vacuum carpets, rugs and furniture often, preferably with a HEPA vacuum.
Wash and dry stuffed toys ‚Äì consider toys other than stuffed animals.
Consider replacing bedroom carpeting with hard floors.
Reduce humidity levels to 50% with an air conditioner or dehumidifier.
Keep stuffed toys out of the bed.


Cockroaches and Other Pests
Cockroaches and other pests such as mice are common asthma triggers.  The cleaner you can keep your home the better although it is difficult to completely eliminate them in certain environments.
What you can do?
Keep counters, sinks, tables, and floors clean.  Never leave food out.
Clean dishes, crumbs, and spills and don‚Äôt eat in your bedroom.
Store food in air tight containers.
Cover trash cans.
If a spray is used to kill roaches, stay out of the room until the odor goes away.



Strong Odors and Sprays
Try to stay away from strong odors and sprays, such as perfume, talcum powder, hair spray, and paints.

Wood Smoke
Similar to cigarette smoke, smoke from wood-burning stoves and fireplaces contain a mixture of harmful gases and small particles.  According to the EPA, ‚ÄúStudies show that an estimated 70% of smoke from chimneys can actually re-enter your home...‚Äù If you‚Äôre using a fireplace or wood stove and smell smoke, it probably isn‚Äôt working properly and you should contact a certified chimney sweep to resolve the issue.

What you can do
If possible, replace your old wood stove with a new, cleaner heating appliance or do not use.
Make sure to burn dry wood that has been split, stacked, covered and stored for at least 6 months. Never burn garbage, plastics, wrapping paper or pressure-treated wood.
Have your stove and chimney inspected every year by a certified professional to make sure there are no gaps, cracks, unwanted drafts or to remove dangerous creosote build-up.

Pets - Cats and Dogs
Sadly our family member pets can trigger allergic reactions as well as asthma attacks.  Some people are allergic to the flakes of skin or dried saliva from animals with fur or feathers.
What you can do
Keep pets outside if possible.
If you have a pet inside, keep them out of the bedroom and off the furniture.
Remove carpets and furniture covered with cloth from your home. If that is not possible, keep the pet away from fabric-covered furniture and carpets.
Vacuum carpets and furniture often.



Chemical Irritants
Chemical irritants found in some products in your house, such as scented or unscented products, including cleaners, paints, adhesives, pesticides, cosmetics, or air fresheners, may make your asthma worse. 
What you can do?
Use these products less often and make sure your child is not around when you use the products. Also, consider using non-chemical based products.
Ventilation - try to make sure that windows or doors are open and that you use an exhaust fan.
Consider an air purifier with carbon media to adsorb gases.

Vacuum Cleaning Tips
- If possible, try to get someone else to vacuum for you once or twice a week.  Stay out of rooms while they are being vacuumed until any dust in the air has settled.
- If you vacuum, use a dust mask (from a hardware store), a double-layered or micro-filter vacuum cleaner bag, or a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter.

Facts:
Allergic reactions to mold are common.
Exposure to environmental contaminants, such as air pollution can worsen the health of persons living with diabetes or cardiovascular disease.

About Mold - molds exist everywhere in nature and are a common component of dust. Mold is a microscopic fungi that requires a food source (ie wallpaper, drywall, etc) and a certain level of moisture or humidity to grow. Mold spreads through the air and can create very serious health issues.

An air purifier will not remove the source of mold but they can help to significantly clean the mold from the air so you can breathe and feel better. HEPA air purifiers are commonly used by mold remediation specialists in the cleanup of toxic mold to capture airborne mold spores.  

What you can do
If you see mold, clean it up with soap and water or bleach.
Ventilation - use exhaust fans or open a window in the bathroom when showering and open windows on dry days to your basement.
Fix leaky plumbing or other sources of water.
Dry damp or wet items to avoid mold growth and try to keep humidity levels at 35%- 50%.
Use a HEPA air purifier to remove the mold spores from the air.


Can mold cause health problems?
Molds produce allergens, irritants, and in some cases, potentially toxic substances (mycotoxins).¬† Inhaling or touching mold or mold spores may cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.¬† Allergic responses include hay fever-type symptoms, such as sneezing, runny nose, red eyes, and skin rash (dermatitis).¬† 

Allergic reactions to mold are common.¬† They can be immediate or delayed.¬† Molds can also cause asthma attacks in people with asthma who are allergic to mold.¬† In addition, mold exposure can irritate the eyes, skin, nose, throat, and lungs of both mold-allergic and non-allergic people.

Smoke Facts:

Indoor air in U.S. homes is up to 100 times more polluted than outdoor air when smoke is present.
90% of our lives are spent indoors.

Smoke Triggers in Your Home and What You Can Do
Our air purifiers (help me choose) will help you get fresher air from a smoke environment however here are some extra steps that the EPA suggests. 


What you can do for the best air quality
Source control (if possible)
If you smoke, ask your doctor for ways to help you quit.
Don‚Äôt smoke in your home or car.
Don‚Äôt let anyone smoke near your child.
Use a HEPA air purifier to capture smoke particulates and a carbon filter to remove the smoke gases.

How Does Secondhand Smoke Get Into An Apartment?
Secondhand smoke¬†can enter your apartment through light fixtures, electric outlets, crawl spaces, windows, and doorways.¬† There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke and eliminating smoking in indoor spaces is the only way to fully protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke exposure.

			Childhood asthma is among the most costly chronic conditions to manage. At Oransi, the quality of care children with asthma receive is one of our top priorities. Our goal is to improve the lives of many through a variety of comprehensive approaches. Oransi collaborates with programs which actively address childhood asthma through education, advocacy, outreach, and intervention.

			Through our AirLift Asthma Relief Initiative, Oransi is providing $75,000 worth of HEPA air purifiers to serve nearly 500 family members through our collaboration with the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) Nursing Asthma Program in the the year 2015.
		</div>
		<div class=""airlift_section_about"">
			<p>
				The mission of the LAUSD Nursing Services Asthma Program is to improve the health and academic achievement of students with asthma by reducing asthma severity through the education of students, parents, and staff on the prevention and management of asthma.
			</p>
			<p>
				An estimated 63,000 students in LAUSD have asthma; the vast majority of the referrals to assist school-age children with poorly controlled asthma are students of low socio-economic status, with 98% in the federal Free or Reduced Price Lunch Program. Because asthma  also can be linked to environmental and behavioral conditions, it is critical to offer a coordinated school health model that integrates schools, teachers, parents, and mental and health education programs to provide lasting support and positive change.

    <div id=""our-promise"">
        <p id=""header-text"">As allergy and asthma sufferers ourselves, we have tried most of the air purifiers on the market and haven't found a competitor's product that has met our needs. With that as a background we build products that we need and want to use. We built the first high performance air purifiers made in USA with all of the key components from the US except for the motor (Germany). These products are being sold in the US but also exported to Asia given their air quality issues. We also built a company that we would want to do business with. Oransi, pronounced (oh-ron-see).</p>

                <h3>effective</h3>
                <p>Bottom line, an Oransi product is built to get the job done. All new products are now made in the US and the Erik series uses the best motor and filters in the world.</p>

        <div id=""our-story-text"">
            <div id=""our-story-text-left"">
                <p>Oransi began as an engineer's quest to find better indoor air quality for his asthmatic son.</p>
                <p>Here is Peter's story:<br/>I first became interested in air purifiers when my son struggled with asthma as an infant and young child.  As a parent, I felt helpless and often the medicine prescribed by the doctors seemed worse than him not being able to breathe.  I tried most of the air purifiers on the market and was not satisfied that they were properly cleaning the air.  So, for more than 12 years now we have been designing and making air purifiers to provide the cleanest air possible.</p>
                <p>Our initial products focused on high quality and affordability especially as it relates to filter replacement costs.  We have since added commercial air purifiers and make the best air purifiers in the world.  All of our new products are made in the US. Our business is set up differently than most in that our customer service team is made up of stay at home moms in the Austin area. When possible we encourage our employees to work from home since it benefits them and you.</p>
            </div>
            <div id=""our-story-text-right"">
                <p>As a global company with offices in the US and China, we are different in that we tailor our solutions to meet the needs of each market.  When you purchase an Oransi product you are getting the latest technology providing you with the cleanest air possible, while also sharing our company's mission to alleviate asthma, support students and improve the environment.</p>
                <p>HEPA technology was invented in America and Oransi works with the leading American scientists to further innovate our HEPA and carbon filters to provide you with the latest technology and cleanest air.</p>
                <p>Oransi is a variation of Oranssi, a Finnish word that means orange, a tribute to our founder's hometown and heritage.  We are a veteran owned business.</p>
